# WhereMyBusAh (@next branch)
__*Please note that everything inside this branch is for the upcoming iteration of WMBA, and it is not yet stable. It is for interested parties that likes testing out new features or just for debugging purposes*__
> For those Singaporeans always wanting to check bus arrivals!

# Download / Installation
**Build on your own or proceed to the release folder with the *latest* build of WMBA (doesn't mean its the latest version yet)**

# Disclaimer
*Since this app is not production-ready (unless stated in a Release), It is not my fault if you use the app for daily use and is late for work or school, etc. because the app keeps crashing or whatever!*
