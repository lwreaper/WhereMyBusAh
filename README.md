# WhereMyBusAh
For those Singaporeans always wanting to check bus arrivals!

# Download / Installation
**Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/lwreaper/WhereMyBusAh/releases) section!**
-  First, download the APK and enable unstrusted sources when asked to.
-  When a dialog box from __Google Play Protect__ appear prompting you to double-check before installing, please install the app anyway. The reason why GPP is doing that is because I am an untrusted developer (and have not signed up for a developer account yet).

# Thanks to:
[@cheeaun](https://github.com/cheeaun) - For providing us with your ArriveLah API! (So I don't need to keep my SECRET_KEY inside these files!)

# Disclaimer
*Since this app is not production-ready (unless stated in a Release), It is not my fault if you use the app for daily use and is late for work or school, etc. because the app keeps crashing or whatever!*
